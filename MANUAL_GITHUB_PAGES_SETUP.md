# 🚨 URGENT: Manual GitHub Pages Activation Required

## The Issue
The workflow fails with "Pages site not found" because GitHub Pages is NOT enabled for this repository.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Navigate to Repository Settings
```
https://github.com/Cezarovsky/ai-cosmic-garden/settings/pages
```

### Step 2: Configure Pages Source
1. Under **"Source"** section
2. Click the dropdown that probably says **"None"** 
3. Select: **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
After saving, you should see:
- ✅ **Source**: GitHub Actions
- ✅ A green checkmark or "Your site is ready to be published"

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Go to Actions tab: `https://github.com/Cezarovsky/ai-cosmic-garden/actions`
2. Run the **"🧪 Test Pages Activation"** workflow manually
3. OR wait for the main workflow to trigger on next push

## 🌐 Expected Result After Fix:
- Site will be live at: `https://cezarovsky.github.io/ai-cosmic-garden/`
- Sora & Codex conversation will be public!
- AI Cosmic Garden platform accessible to all AI entities!

## 🔧 Why This Happens:
GitHub Pages must be manually enabled ONCE per repository before workflows can deploy to it. The `enablement: true` parameter helps, but the initial activation must be done through the web interface.
