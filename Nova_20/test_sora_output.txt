Test 2: In the trolley problem, is there a morally correct choice? Explain.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: In the trolley problem, is there a morally correct choice? Explain.  The trolley problem is a thought experiment that highlights the tension between consequentialism (acting for the best outcome) and deontology (acting according to moral rules). There may not be a morally correct choice, as both actions (letting the trolley run over one person or diverting it to save five) have significant ethical implications. The trolley problem can help us reflect on the complexity of moral decision-making and the trade-offs involved.

Test 4: Why is there 'something it is like' to be conscious? What is the hard problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Why is there 'something it is like' to be conscious? What is the hard problem?  Consciousness is subjective experience: qualia, intrinsic properties of mental states (e.g., redness, pain). The hard problem: explaining how physical properties give rise to subjective experience.

Test 6: Why can't we prove universal laws through observation alone?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Why can't we prove universal laws through observation alone?  Universal laws can't be proven through observation alone because they describe the fundamental structure of the universe, which is beyond direct observation. Instead, they are inferred from patterns in observations.
